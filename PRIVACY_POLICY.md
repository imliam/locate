# Privacy Policy for Locate

**Last Updated:** December 9, 2025

## Overview

Locate is a browser extension designed to help you find and interact with content on web pages. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how the extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.** Locate operates entirely within your browser and does not transmit any information to external servers owned or operated by us.

## Data Storage

All extension settings and preferences are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's built-in storage APIs. This data never leaves your device and includes:

- Extension preferences and settings
- User-configured options

## AI Integration (Optional)

Locate offers optional AI-powered features that require integration with third-party AI providers. If you choose to use these features:

- **You provide your own API keys** for the AI services you wish to use
- **API keys are stored locally** in your browser and are never transmitted to us
- **When using AI features**, your queries are sent directly from your browser to the AI provider you have configured (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- **We have no access** to your API keys or the data you send to these AI services

Please review the privacy policies of any AI providers you choose to use:
- [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/)
- [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## Permissions

The extension requests certain browser permissions to function. These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality:

- **Active Tab / Host Permissions**: To interact with and search content on web pages you visit
- **Storage**: To save your preferences locally in your browser

## Third-Party Services

Other than the optional AI integrations that you configure yourself, Locate does not connect to any third-party services or external servers.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data because we do not collect any data. Your information stays on your device.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
